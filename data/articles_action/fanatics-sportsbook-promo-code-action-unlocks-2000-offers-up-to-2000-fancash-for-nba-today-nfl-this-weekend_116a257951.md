How to Use Fanatics Sportsbook Promo Code ACTION on Lakers vs. Clippers Prediction
Register with the Fanatics Sportsbook promo code ACTION and claim the $2,000 promo before you bet on NBA odds of -500 or longer. Thanks to this Fanatics Sportsbook promo, you get up to $200 back in FanCash if your No Sweat Bet loses.
Take a look at my Lakers vs. Clippers prediction below for an example of how a No Sweat Bet functions. I used the Action Network parlay calculator to determine the odds of my parlay are +450.
- James Harden 28+ points (-110)
- Luka Doncic 33+ points (+100)
- LeBron James 7+ assists (-130)
Place a $200 No Sweat Bet on my parlay and get a total payout of $1,100 if you win, or $200 back in FanCash if you lose. This is one of the best NBA betting promos because it permits you to place a No Sweat Bet each of the next nine days as well.
