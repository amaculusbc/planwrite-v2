FanDuel offers its sign-up bonus in most legal sports betting states and pairs it with ongoing NBA betting promos. You place a $5 first bet and get $200 in bonus bets if your wager wins. Check the chart below to see the complete list of states where this offer is available.
Use New FanDuel Promo Code Offer to Bet Sunday's Lakers vs. Knicks
When you register with the FanDuel promo code today, take advantage of a $200 bet-and-get offer. Place a $5+ first bet and get $200 in bonus bets if you win. Today's NBA slate offers new users the opportunity to get started at FanDuel Sportsbook with a wealth of outstanding matchups, including Lakers vs. Knicks. Let's dive in and look at a betting example to demonstrate how this sign-up offer functions.
There is no minimum odds requirement for the FanDuel promo code offer. As a result, Action Network experts strongly advise that you place your first bet on a heavy favorite. This gives you the best chance to claim the $200 bonus. For example, say I place a $5 first bet on the Knicks +20.5 at -5000 odds against the Lakers:
- If the bet wins, I get my $5 stake back and $200 in bonus bets.
- If the bet loses, I get nothing with the FanDuel promo code.
Because the potential downside is getting nothing from the sign-up offer if my first bet results in a loss, placing my initial wager on a massive favorite is important.
