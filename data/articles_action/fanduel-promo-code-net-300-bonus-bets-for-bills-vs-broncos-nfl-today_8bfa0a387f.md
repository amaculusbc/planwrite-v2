Use FanDuel Promo Code to Bet on Bills vs. Broncos Prediction Today
Take advantage of the FanDuel promo code to maximize your experience as a new bettor. Place a $5 first bet once you create your FanDuel account and unlock $300 in bonus bets if your initial wager wins. The value is clear in a competitive betting landscape where every edge counts.
My advice to you is to wager on as short of NFL odds as possible. For example, my Bills vs. Broncos prediction is Broncos +26.5 (-50000). The Action Network betting odds calculator projects you win next to nothing when you bet on this ALT spread.
But the likelihood of the Broncos losing by 27 or more is incredibly slim, which means you get $300 in bonus bets when you place a $5 first bet on my prediction and it hits.
FanDuel bonus bets expire after seven days, which encourages you to act swiftly and wager on other NFL Divisional Round games. Check out our parlay calculator to try and create a parlay on other NFL postseason betting markets and win big.
Allow me to leave you with an endorsement of the FanDuel promo codeby fellow sportsbook expert Chris Ilenstine, who has this to say.
