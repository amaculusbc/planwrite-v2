Novig is different from online sports betting, but the Action Network Super Bowl betting primer is still a good resource to read up on to help you make your picks. Here are a few of my SB 60 predictions.
- Seahawks moneyline (-213): I think the Seahawks have a deeper and better defense, and more explosive playmakers than the Patriots.
- Stefon Diggs over 4.5 receptions (-105): Look for Drake Maye to rely on his most experienced teammate in the postseason early.
- Cooper Kupp over 2.5 receptions (-142): Cooper Kupp is the embodiment of NFL Big Game experience as the only active Super Bowl MVP in this game.
