FanDuel Promo Code: Claim $200 Bonus with Best Super Bowl Betting Promo
Register now with the FanDuel promo code to claim a $200 bet-and-get offer for tonight's matchup between the Seattle Seahawks and the New England Patriots at 6:30 p.m. ET on NBC. This FanDuel welcome bonus represents the best Super Bowl betting promo to claim today. Let's dive in and discuss how this bet-and-get works by breaking down a betting example from the Super Bowl best bets from our team at Action Network.
Suppose I place a $5 first bet on the Seahawks moneyline (-230):
- If the bet wins, I get $2.17 in profit, my $5 stake back, and $200 in bonus bets.
- If the bet loses, I get nothing.
Because the downside is getting nothing from the sign-up offer if my first bet results in a loss, placing my initial wager on a massive favorite is imperative when considering Super Bowl odds.
