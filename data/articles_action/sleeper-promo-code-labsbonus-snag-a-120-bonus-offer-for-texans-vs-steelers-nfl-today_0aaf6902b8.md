Sleeper promo code LABSBONUS: Create a Texans vs. Steelers lineup with NFL picks
Sign up with the Sleeper promo code LABSBONUS to claim a $20 bonus plus a 100% deposit match worth up to $100 on one of the top DFS sites. Once your bonus funds arrive, you can start building your first Sleeper entry by choosing two to eight player picks and selecting whether each will finish “More” or “Less” than their listed projection. Each additional pick beyond the first two increases your overall payout multiplier.
Create your account today with the Sleeper Fantasy promo code LABSBONUS, then build a lineup using your favorite NFL Wild Card Round picks from Texans vs. Steelers. Below are my recommended plays for this weekend’s slate to help you get started.
- C.J. Stroud to get “More” than 228.5 passing yards (NFL)
- Woody Marks to get “Less” than 55.5 rushing yards (NFL)
- DK Metcalf to get “More” than 54.5 receiving yards (NFL)
After locking in your player picks, decide how you want to submit your lineup. A Max entry delivers the biggest payout multiplier, but it requires perfection—every selection must hit for the ticket to cash. A Flex entry provides a margin for error, allowing you to earn a payout even if one pick falls short, though the multiplier is smaller to reflect the reduced risk.
On Sleeper, each projection carries its own multiplier, so your total potential payout depends on three things: the players you choose, how many picks you include, and whether you opt for the Max or Flex format.
