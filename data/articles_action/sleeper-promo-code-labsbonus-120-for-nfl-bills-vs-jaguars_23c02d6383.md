Use Sleeper Promo Code LABSBONUS to Make Bills vs. Jaguars Predictions Today
Fund your NFL predictions today with $120 in bonus cash thanks to the FantasyLabs Sleeper promo code LABSBONUS. Like any other DFS site (such as FanDuel Predicts), your job on Sleeper is to pick whether players go for “More” or “Less” than their projected statistics. Real money can be won if your picks hit, so why wouldn’t you want to receive $120 in bonuses to pay for your entries?
When I open the Sleeper app, I gravitate towards the Bills and Jaguars clash at 1 p.m. ET today. Nobody wants to face Josh Allen in the playoffs, but I think the Jaguars can hang offensively, and have enough defensive firepower to keep the league MVP in check. Here are my Bills vs. Jaguars picks from Sleeper Fantasy.
- Josh Allen LESS than 1.5 passing touchdowns
- James Cook MORE than 0.5 anytime touchdowns
- Trevor Lawrence MORE than 21.5 completions
- Brian Thomas Jr. LESS than 0.5 anytime touchdowns
Every Sleeper pick ’em entry you go to submit pays out a couple of different ways depending on your choice. Pick Max payout when you use my 4-pick entry above and win 6.44x if every prediction hits. When you select Flex payout, you win 3.26x if all four picks are correct, or 1.24x if three picks are right.
Try your hand at Sleeper NFL picks today thanks to the Sleeper promo code LABSBONUS. There are three other NFL Wild Card round games to make picks on outside of the Bills vs. Jaguars, so feel free to save some bonus cash for those games as well.
