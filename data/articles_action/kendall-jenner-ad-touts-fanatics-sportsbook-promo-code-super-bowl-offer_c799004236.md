Seahawks vs. Patriots: Who Will Kendall Pick?
At 11:30 p.m. ET, Fanatics Sportsbook will reveal Kendall Jenner's pick for Seahawks vs. Patriots on social media. It is not yet clear which team Jenner will pick, but if I were her, my prediction for the Seahawks vs. Patriots game would be the Patriots moneyline, which is listed at +190 on Fanatics Sportsbook. These odds qualify for your bet match promotion from the Fanatics Sportsbook promo code ACTION.
I believe that the Patriots' run game, led by Rhamondre Stevenson, can be the key to cracking the elite Seahawks defense. We have seen the Seahawks show a weakness against the run, and perhaps we can see the Patriots come out on top on the strength of their ground game. Sign up today, and bet on the Patriots moneyline (+190) after you see the Kendal Jenner ad at 11:30 p.m. ET with the Fanatics Sportsbook promo code ACTION today.
