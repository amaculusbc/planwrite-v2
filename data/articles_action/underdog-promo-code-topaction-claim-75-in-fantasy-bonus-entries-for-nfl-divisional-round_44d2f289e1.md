Underdog Promo Code TOPACTION: Snag $75 in Fantasy Bonus Entries for NFL Divisional Round
With four NFL Playoff matchups on deck in this week’s Divisional Round, it’s a great time to get started with the Underdog promo code TOPACTION. Sign up for a new account, submit a $5+ entry, and receive $75 in fantasy bonus entries regardless of how your first lineup performs. Below, we’ll break down how Underdog entries work so you can take full advantage of the welcome offer.
At Underdog, players can choose between two entry types: Standard and Flex. A Standard entry requires every pick to hit in order to receive a payout, while a Flex entry offers a bit of protection—you can win all picks or miss just one and still earn a return. The trade-off is that Flex entries come with smaller payouts when all picks hit, whereas Standard entries compensate you with higher multipliers for the added risk.
Here’s an example of an entry I created for the NFL Divisional Round, with picks from Texans vs. Pats and Rams vs. Bears.
- Rhamondre Stevenson Higher Than 63.5 Rush Yards
- Nick Chubb Higher Than 57.5 Rush Yards
- Puka Nacua Higher Than 52.5 Receiving Yards
With a three-pick Standard entry, hitting all three projections returns 6x your stake. Switch to Flex, and a perfect card pays 3x, while a single missed pick still returns 1x, giving you a layer of protection.
