How to Make Trades with Kalshi Promo Code ACTION
Kalshi is a trading platform where you can buy and sell shares of event outcomes in many different sectors, including sports, politics, and world events. Kalshi operates very similarly to the stock market where share prices fluctuate due to market demand. The best time to get started with the Kalshi promo code ACTION is now with the Divisional Round of the NFL playoffs set to start today.
At Kalshi, each share has a price. For example, suppose an outcome share is priced at $0.30, which is viewed as an implied probability of 30%. If you purchase a $0.30 share that is proven to be a correct prediction, the value of the share moves to $1. If the prediction is incorrect, your share becomes worthless and is removed from your portfolio.
Kalshi Promo Code ACTION: Make NFL Playoffs Predictions Now
Let's take a look at an example of a trade you can make to secure your $10 bonus with the Kalshi promo code ACTION. The Buffalo Bills are currently trading at $0.50 to win versus the Denver Broncos in the AFC Divisional Round game at 4:30 p.m. ET on CBS. Suppose I purchase 200 shares of the Bills for a total cost of $100:
- If the prediction is correct, each of my $0.50 shares move to $1 in value for a new total value of $200 ($100 in profit).
- If the prediction is incorrect, each of my $0.50 shares becomes worthless for a new total value of $0 ($100 total loss).
Additionally, I receive a $10 bonus regardless of the outcome of my prediction.
