Sleeper Promo Code: Make These Patriots vs. Broncos Picks When You Sign Up
Use the Sleeper promo code LABSBONUS to create your account ahead of the Patriots vs. Broncos game to make NFL DFS picks and predictions. As I mentioned earlier, your job is to guess how well or poorly players perform in comparison to their statistics projected by Sleeper.
Take a look at my Sleeper NFL picks below for the AFC Championship game. Between Jarrett Stidham starting at quarterback for Denver and both teams possessing elite scoring defenses, I predict an uneventful game offensively where we may see a lot of field goals.
- Less than 9.5 receiving yards for Austin Hooper
- Less than 73.5 rushing and receiving yards for Rhamondre Stevenson
- More than 1.5 field goals made for Will Lutz
- Less than 50.5 receiving yards for Courtland Sutton
I must submit 4-pick entry above in one of two ways. If I select Max payout, I need all four NFL predictions to hit to win 9.40x my entry fee. When I select Flex payout, I either win 4.76x if each pick is right, or 1.46x if three picks are correct.
If you copy my picks above, remember that you have up to $120 in bonus cash to fund your entry thanks to the Sleeper promo code LABSBONUS. $20 in bonus cash is guaranteed upon the completion of registration. The remaining $100 in potential bonuses is yours to claim through a 100% deposit match offer.
