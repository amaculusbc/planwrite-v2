Underdog Promo Code TOPACTION: Get $75 in Fantasy Bonus Entries for NFL Playoffs
With a quartet of NFL playoffs on tap this week in the Divisional Round, get started with the Underdog promo code TOPACTION. Sign up for a new account, play $5+, and get $75 in fantasy bonus entries regardless of the outcome of your initial entry. Let's take an in-depth look at how entries work at Underdog to give you a better understanding of how to work through the welcome offer.
At Underdog, there are two different types of entries to choose from: Standard and Flex. A Standard entry requires all of your picks to win to receive a payout, while a Flex entry requires you to win all picks or lose just one. The key difference is that a Flex entry provides a much smaller payout when you win all of your picks, while a Standard entry rewards you much more for the risk you take.
Here is an example of an entry I created for the NFL playoffs:
- R.J. Harvey Higher Than 53.5 Rush Yards
- Kenneth Walker III Higher Than 57.5 Rush Yards
- Christian Kirk Higher Than 41.5 Receiving Yards
Suppose I place this entry as my $5 initial entry with the Underdog promo code TOPACTION, which has a 6x payout multiplier. Here is what I receive based on the outcome of it:
- If all of my picks win, I receive a $30 total payout ($25 profit + $5 entry back) and $75 in bonus entries.
- If one or more of my picks lose, I receive $75 in bonus entries.
