What Is the BetMGM Bonus Code ACTIONGET?
The BetMGM bonus code ACTIONGET offers new bettors $150 in bonus bets if your $10 first bet wins. Since there is no minimum odds requirement to concern yourself with, my advice is to bet on favorable NFL odds in the Texans vs. Patriots game today.
For example, place your first bet on Texans +13.5 (-600). The Texans have too elite a defense to lose by two or more touchdowns, in my opinion. There is little profit to be won when you place this bet, but the plus side is your first bet is likelier to hit than if you wagered on a riskier market.
