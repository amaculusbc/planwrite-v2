How to Use DraftKings Promo Code on NFL Wild Card Round
Now is the perfect time to use the DraftKings promo code. The NFL Wild Card Round is in full swing, so you can claim your $300 welcome bonus and bet on any game, including Chargers vs. Patriots on Sunday Night Football.
The latest NFL odds have the Patriots as a 3.5-point favorite over the Chargers. After a 1-2 start, the Patriots have gone 12-1, proving they are one of the top teams this season. While some critics cite their strength of schedule, they should have no problem handling the Chargers.
For our Chargers vs. Patriots prediction, we’re targeting a market close to -500 odds. That’s why a $5 wager on Patriots +5.5 (-495) makes sense.
- Chargers vs. Patriots Prediction: Patriots +5.5 (-495)
If the Patriots win outright or lose by five points or less, you get $300 in bonus bets. DraftKings distributes this bonus as 12 $25 bet credits, which expire in seven days.
Take advantage of the DraftKings promo code to get a $300 welcome bonus for the Chargers vs. Patriots game in the NFL Playoffs. Need more convincing? Here’s what sportsbook expert Nick Goodling has to say:
“If you’ve been waiting for the right time to jump into NFL betting, now is it. The DraftKings promo code gives you $300 in bonus bets, perfect for testing your predictions without risking your own bankroll.” — Nick Goodling, Sportsbook Analyst
