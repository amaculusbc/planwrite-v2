Act now to wager on the Rams vs. Seahawks ahead of kickoff at 6:30 p.m. ET on FOX today, Sunday, January 25, 2026. To increase your chances at the $300 bonus, I encourage you to air on the side of caution when you submit your first bet.
Draftkings Promo Code Overview Today: Sunday, January 25, 2026
The Draftkings promo code appeals to new bettors because it ties the upside to a small first bet, so you can test the sportsbook the need to commit much bankroll. Remember your first bet must meet the -500 minimum odds requirement, and your wager must win to unlock $300 in bonus bets.
With that said, find short betting odds to wager on to increase your chances to win $300 in bonus bets. For example, my Rams vs. Seahawks prediction is Rams +10.5 (-448). The Action Network betting odds calculator projects minimal profit when I bet $5 on this market, but I give myself a great shot at $300 in bonus bets compared to if I place a riskier first bet.

Reasons to Bet the NFC Championship Game on DraftKings Sportsbook
Action Network views the DraftKings promo code as one of the best NFL betting promos for many reasons. For starters, DraftKings offers more bonus bets than what some of their competitors offer. Instead of just $150 or $200 in bonuses, the DraftKings sign-up bonus has $300 in bonus bets up for grabs.
While there is the caveat your first bet must win to secure these funds, the right strategy can help you make this a reality. As long as you wager conservatively and satisfy the -500 or longer minimum odds requirement, you give yourself a strong chance to win your first bet. Time is running out to claim this betting promo, so this is the time to act.
Not only is the DraftKings welcome offer generous, but so is the rest of the sportsbook. Find a plethora of odds boosts and No Sweat Tokens to opt-in to before you bet on the Rams vs. Seahawks. Live bettors can enjoy their competitive odds and deep selection of betting markets as well.
Conclusion: Sign Up With DraftKings Promo Code Now to Bet Rams vs. Seahawks
My final thoughts are that there is too much to possibly gain with the DraftKings promo code to not sign up. There are $300 in bonus bets waiting to be claimed, but you can't receive these funds unless you register now. If you wait, this welcome bonus may be different, as today is the last day it is offered to new customers.
The NFL season is nearly concluded, which opens up opportunity to bet on other sports. Wager on the NBA, college basketball, or any other sport with your bonus bets. While you miss out on bonus bets if your first wager loses, your stake can be as low as $5, which means you don't have to burn a hole in your wallet to try and maximize this welcome offer.
