The Fanatics Sportsbook promo code ACTION gives new users a stacked welcome package worth up to $1,000 in bonus value, just in time for Groundhog Day. When you sign up today, Fanatics Sportsbook lets you choose from six different welcome offers, which you can use to wager on any game, including Seahawks vs. Patriots.
One of the most popular options tied to the Fanatics Sportsbook promo code ACTION is a $100 bet match for 10 straight days. Place a wager on any market with odds of -200 or longer, and if your bet loses, you get your stake back in FanCash, up to $100 per day.
Another strong option available through the Fanatics Sportsbook promo code ACTION is a bet-and-get promo worth up to $300. To unlock the full $300, you must wager $10 per day at -500 odds or longer for five consecutive days. Win or lose, Fanatics Sportsbook rewards you with $100 in FanCash per day, totaling $300 after three days. There’s also a $250 version that pays out $50 in FanCash per day.
For football fans, the Fanatics Sportsbook promo code ACTION also unlocks a 100% Profit Boost Token for Super Bowl 2026. Use this boost on your Seahawks vs. Patriots prediction on the moneyline and double your profit if the bet wins. This NFL promo takes clear inspiration from the Kendall Jenner commercial that helped introduce Fanatics Sportsbook to a national audience.
Bettors in New York can use the Fanatics Sportsbook promo code ACTIONNY to choose between $250 in No Sweat Bets or a daily 100% Profit Boost Token for five straight days.
Fanatics Sportsbook Promo Code ACTION: Bet on Super Bowl LX Now
If you’re planning to bet on the NFL’s biggest game, the Fanatics Sportsbook promo code ACTION delivers multiple ways to unlock bonus value ahead of kickoff. New users can choose from several welcome offers and place bets on Super Bowl LX, featuring Seahawks vs. Patriots on Sunday, February 8 at 6:30 p.m. ET on NBC.
With the Fanatics Sportsbook promo, you can select the offer that best fits your betting style and put it to use on Super Bowl LX. Sportsbook expert Daniel Preciado explains why this promo stands out from the rest of the market.
“This is one of the best Super Bowl welcome bonuses available. With Fanatics’ Bet Match, you get FanCash back whether your first bet wins or loses, giving you upside on Super Bowl LX. If you’re not claiming this before kickoff, you’re missing out on real betting value.”
If you choose the $1,000 Bet Match, you can place your Seahawks vs. Patriots prediction on any market priced at -200 odds or longer. The key advantage is flexibility: even if your first bet doesn’t hit, you get FanCash equal to your wager, which you can convert into bonus bets at a 1:1 ratio.
That safety net opens the door to higher-upside plays, including a Super Bowl TD scorer pick. Let’s tail the Action Network experts and place a $100 wager on Drake Maye anytime touchdown scorer (+325).
- Seahawks vs. Patriots Prediction: Drake Maye Anytime TD Scorer (+325)
Using an odds calculator, a Maye touchdown returns a $425 payout on a $100 bet.

Check out the 2026 Super Bowl betting trends before making your Seahawks vs. Patriots picks.
Whether you found Fanatics Sportsbook through the Kendall Jenner commercial or you’re actively shopping for the best Super Bowl betting promos, the Fanatics Sportsbook promo code ACTION offers real flexibility and bonus value for betting on the NFL Big Game.
