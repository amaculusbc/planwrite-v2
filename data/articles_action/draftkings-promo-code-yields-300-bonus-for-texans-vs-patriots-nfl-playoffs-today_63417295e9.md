DraftKings Promo Code Overview for NFL Divisional Round Today
The $300 Texans vs. Patriots betting promo from the DraftKings promo code is straightforward. Win your first bet to unlock $300 in bonus bets, or lose your first bet and get nothing. My advice is to save long shot bets or parlays for later, and submit your first bet on the shortest odds possible.

Place This Texans vs. Patriots Prediction to Win $300 Bonus Bets With DraftKings Sign-Up Bonus
Two of the better defenses in the NFL do battle in the Divisional Round today, and there a plethora of betting markets to wager on once you sign up with the DraftKings promo code. With that in mind, a betting line with odds as close to -500 as possible to help maximize the chances you win.
My Texans vs. Patriots prediction on DraftKings is Under 51.5 total points (-451). The Texans' calling card is their defense, which holds opponents to just 16.7 points per game. On the other side, the Patriots surrender just 17.9 points on average. When you bet $5 on my Texans vs. Patriots best bet, the Action Network betting odds calculator projects a total payout of $6.11 if you win.
That said, you get $300 in bonus bets as well when you win. More money can be made off a riskier bet, like under 40.5 total points (-105), but why take that risk when $300 in bonus bets are on the line?
