theScore Bet Promo Code ACTNEWS: Get a $1,000 Bonus for the Seahawks vs. Patriots Matchup
Create a new account right now with the theScore Bet promo code ACTNEWS to claim the brand-new $1,000 First Bet Reset offer for The Big Game between the Seahawks vs. Patriots or any other sports market. This newly released promo allows new users to place their first bet with added protection. If your first wager loses, you get your stake back in bonus bets, up to $1,000.
Because this is a bet protection offer, many bettors choose to place their first wager on a larger payout opportunity since the bet comes with a built-in safety net. Here's a quick example of how this First Bet Reset works when betting on Super Bowl 60 odds:
Let’s say I place a $1,000 wager on the Patriots moneyline (+190). Here are the possible outcomes:
- If my bet wins, I earn $1,900 in profit and get my original $1,000 stake back.
- If my bet loses, I get five $200 bonus bet credits (20% of my $1,000 stake), totaling $1,000 in bonus bets through theScore Bet promo code ACTNEWS, giving me multiple chances to place additional wagers.
When you use bonus bets earned through theScore Bet promo code ACTNEWS, they don't return your stake, but you can withdraw any winnings after meeting applicable playthrough requirements.
