The Seahawks look to dominate the 49ers again behind a dual-threat rushing attack from Kenneth Walker III and Zach Charbonnet. On the other side, the 49ers are limited on offense and will need strong performances from Brock Purdy and Christian McCaffrey to pull out a win. Expect a heavy run game from both sides, exceptional defense, and low offensive passing numbers.
